## Introduction

After competing in multiple robotics competitions, we've learned some valuable lessons. Here are our top tips for competition success.

## 1. Test, Test, Test

Never assume your robot will work perfectly on competition day. Testing helps you:

- Find mechanical weaknesses
- Identify software bugs
- Practice driver skills
- Time your autonomous routines

**Pro tip**: Test in conditions similar to competition (lighting, floor surface, distractions).

## 2. Have a Backup Plan

Things will go wrong. Be prepared with:

- Spare parts for common failures
- Backup code versions
- Alternative strategies if your main approach fails
- Multiple team members who understand each system

## 3. Practice Driver Skills

The best robot means nothing without skilled drivers. Practice:

- Speed runs (optimize time)
- Precision runs (perfect accuracy)
- Stress scenarios (simulating competition pressure)
- Driver handoffs if using multiple drivers

## 4. Document Everything

Keep detailed records:

```markdown
## Practice Log - Oct 10, 2025
- Autonomous: 85% success rate (up from 70%)
- Issue: Right motor occasionally stalls
- Fix: Replaced motor controller
- Next: Test motor under load
```

Good documentation helps you track progress and quickly solve recurring problems.

## 5. Scout Other Teams

Learn from competitors:
- Watch their strategies
- Note clever mechanisms
- Identify common challenges
- Network with other teams

Robotics competitions are collaborative. Most teams are happy to share ideas!

## Bonus: Stay Calm

Competition day is stressful. Remember:
- Take breaks
- Support your teammates
- Learn from mistakes
- Have fun!

The goal isn't just winningâ€”it's learning and growing as engineers and teammates.

Good luck at your next competition!
