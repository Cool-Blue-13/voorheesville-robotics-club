## Introduction to Arduino

Arduino is the perfect platform for getting started with robotics. It's beginner-friendly, affordable, and powerful enough for complex projects.

## What You'll Need

- Arduino Uno board
- USB cable
- Breadboard
- LEDs and resistors
- Motor controller (optional)

## Your First Program

Let's start with the classic "Blink" program:

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```

This code makes the built-in LED blink every second. Simple, but it teaches the basic structure of Arduino programs.

## Understanding the Code

### setup() Function
Runs once when the Arduino starts. Used for initialization:
- Set pin modes (INPUT or OUTPUT)
- Initialize serial communication
- Set up sensors and motors

### loop() Function
Runs continuously after setup(). This is where your main program logic goes.

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with basic programs, try:

1. **Reading Sensors**: Use ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles
2. **Controlling Motors**: Drive DC motors and servos
3. **Serial Communication**: Send data to your computer
4. **Multiple Inputs**: Combine sensors for complex behavior

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting pinMode()**: Always declare if a pin is INPUT or OUTPUT
2. **Too Short Delays**: Give sensors time to stabilize
3. **Wrong Pin Numbers**: Double-check your wiring matches the code
4. **No Serial.begin()**: Required before using Serial.print()
