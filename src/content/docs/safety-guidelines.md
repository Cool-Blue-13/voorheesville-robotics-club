## Safety is Everyone's Responsibility

Our #1 priority is keeping everyone safe. Please read and follow these guidelines at all times.

## General Workshop Rules

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- ✅ Safety glasses required at all times in the workshop
- ✅ Closed-toe shoes (no sandals or flip-flops)
- ✅ Tie back long hair
- ✅ Remove jewelry that could get caught in equipment
- ✅ No loose clothing near moving machinery

### Before You Start
1. **Get Training**: Never use equipment without proper training
2. **Check Tools**: Inspect tools for damage before use
3. **Ask Questions**: If unsure, ask an advisor or experienced member
4. **Know Emergency Procedures**: Location of fire extinguisher, first aid kit, emergency stop buttons

## Equipment-Specific Safety

### 3D Printers
- Never reach into a running printer
- Hot end temperatures reach 200-260°C
- Ensure proper ventilation
- Don't leave prints unattended
- Let prints cool before removing

### Soldering
- Work in ventilated area
- Soldering iron tip reaches 350°C+
- Always return iron to stand
- Wash hands after soldering
- Don't touch tip or recently soldered joints

### Power Tools
**Drill Press**:
- Secure workpiece with clamp, never hold by hand
- Remove chuck key before starting
- Wear safety glasses

**Dremel/Rotary Tools**:
- Secure small parts
- Start at low speed
- Keep hands clear of spinning bits

### Electronics
- Check polarity before powering circuits
- Never work on live circuits
- Use appropriate voltage/current ratings
- Disconnect batteries when not testing
- Know how to handle LiPo batteries safely

## Lithium Polymer (LiPo) Battery Safety

LiPos are powerful but potentially dangerous if mishandled:

### Charging
- ✅ Use only proper LiPo chargers
- ✅ Never exceed 1C charge rate unless specified
- ✅ Charge in a fire-safe container
- ✅ Never leave charging unattended
- ❌ Never charge damaged or swollen batteries

### Storage
- Store at 3.8V per cell (storage mode)
- Keep in cool, dry place
- Use fire-safe LiPo bags

### Usage
- Never discharge below 3.0V per cell
- Don't puncture or damage cells
- Discontinue use if battery swells or gets hot

### Disposal
- Don't throw in regular trash
- Discharge to 0V with salt water method
- Bring to battery recycling center

## Emergency Procedures

### Fire
1. Alert everyone in the room
2. If small, use fire extinguisher (PASS method)
3. If large, evacuate and pull fire alarm
4. Never use water on electrical fires

### Injury
1. Stop work immediately
2. Get advisor/adult help
3. Administer first aid if trained
4. Call 911 for serious injuries
5. Fill out incident report

### Electrical Shock
1. Don't touch the person
2. Turn off power source
3. Get adult help immediately
4. Call 911

## Workshop Etiquette

- Clean up your workspace
- Return tools to proper locations
- Report broken or unsafe equipment
- Respect others' projects and space
- No food or drinks near electronics

## Certification Requirements

Before using certain equipment, you must:
1. Attend safety training session
2. Pass written safety quiz
3. Demonstrate proper use under supervision
4. Get certified by advisor

Equipment requiring certification:
- 3D printers
- Laser cutter
- Drill press
- Soldering stations (advanced)

## Questions About Safety?

Never hesitate to ask! It's always better to ask than to risk injury.
